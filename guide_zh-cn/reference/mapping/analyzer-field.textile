p. The @_analyzer@ mapping allows to use a document field property as the name of the analyzer that will be used to index the document. The analyzer will be used for any field that does not explicitly defines an @analyzer@ or @index_analyzer@ when indexing.

p. Here is a simple mapping:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "type1" : {
        "_analyzer" : {
            "path" : "my_field"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The above will use the value of the @my_field@ to lookup an analyzer registered under it. For example, indexing a the following doc:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "my_field" : "whitespace"
}
</pre>

p. Will cause the @whitespace@ analyzer to be used as the index analyzer for all fields without explicit analyzer setting.

p. The default path value is @_analyzer@, so the analyzer can be driven for a specific document by setting @_analyzer@ field in it. If custom json field name is needed, an explicit mapping with a different path should be set.

p. By default, the @_analyzer@ field is indexed, it can be disabled by settings @index@ to @no@ in the mapping.
