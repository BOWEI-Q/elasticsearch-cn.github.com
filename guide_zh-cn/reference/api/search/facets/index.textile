The usual purpose of a full-text search engine is to return a small number of documents matching your query.

_Facets_ provide aggregated data based on a search query. In the simplest case, a "terms facet":/guide/reference/api/search/facets/terms-facet.html can return _facet counts_ for various _facet values_ for a specific _field_. ElasticSearch supports more more facet implementations, such as "statistical":/guide/reference/api/search/facets/statistical-facet.html or "date histogram":/guide/reference/api/search/facets/date-histogram-facet.html facets.

The field used for facet calculations _must_ be of type numeric, date/time or be analyzed as a single token &mdash; see the "_Mapping_":/guide/reference/mapping/index.html guide for details on the analysis process.

You can give the facet a custom _name_ and return multiple facets in one request.

Let's try it out with a simple example. Suppose we have a number of articles with a field called @tags@, preferably analyzed with the "keyword":/guide/reference/index-modules/analysis/keyword-analyzer.html analyzer. The facet aggregation will return counts for the most popular tags across the documents matching your query &mdash; or across all documents in the index.

We will store some example data first:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9200/articles"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/articles/article" -d '{"title" : "One",   "tags" : ["foo"]}'
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/articles/article" -d '{"title" : "Two",   "tags" : ["foo", "bar"]}'
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/articles/article" -d '{"title" : "Three", "tags" : ["foo", "bar", "baz"]}'
</pre>

Now, let's query the index for articles beginning with letter “T” and retrieve a "_terms facet_":/guide/reference/api/search/facets/terms-facet.html for the @tags@ field. We will name the facet simply: _tags_.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/articles/_search?pretty=true" -d '
  {
    "query" : { "query_string" : {"query" : "T*"} },
    "facets" : {
      "tags" : { "terms" : {"field" : "tags"} }
    }
  }
'
</pre>

This request will return articles “Two” and “Three” (because they match our query), as well as the @tags@ facet:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
"facets" : {
  "tags" : {
    "_type" : "terms",
    "missing" : 0,
    "total": 5,
    "other": 0,
    "terms" : [ {
      "term" : "foo",
      "count" : 2
    }, {
      "term" : "bar",
      "count" : 2
    }, {
      "term" : "baz",
      "count" : 1
    } ]
  }
}
</pre>

In the @terms@ array, relevant _terms_ and _counts_ are returned. You'll probably want to display these to your users. The facet also returns the number of documents which have no value for the field (@missing@), the number of facet values not included in the returned facets (@other@), and the total number of tokens in the facet (@total@).

Notice, that the counts are scoped to the current query: _foo_ is counted only twice (not three times), _bar_ is counted twice and _baz_ once.

That's because the primary purpose of facets is to enable "_faceted navigation_":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search, allowing the user to refine her query based on the insight from the facet, ie. restrict the search to a specific category, price or date range. See the example of faceted navigation at _LinkedIn_ below:

!/guide/images/linkedin-faceted-search.png(Faceted Search at LinkedIn)!

Facets can be used, however, for other purposes: computing histograms, statistical aggregations, and more. See the article about "data visualization":/blog/2011/05/13/data-visualization-with-elasticsearch-and-protovis.html on the ElasticSearch's blog for inspiration.

h2. Scope

As we have already mentioned, facet computation is restricted to the scope of the current query, called @main@, by default. Facets can be computed within the @global@ scope as well, in which case it will return values computed acrosss all documents in the index:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "facets" : {
        "<FACET NAME>" : {
            "<FACET TYPE>" : { ... },
            "global" : true
        }
    }
}    
</pre>

There's one **important distinction** to keep in mind. While search _queries_ restrict both the returned documents and facet counts, search _filters_ restrict only returned documents &mdash; but _not_ facet counts.

If you need to restrict both the documents and facets, and you're not willing or able to use a query, you may use a _facet filter_.

h2. Facet Filter

All facets can be configured with an additional filter (explained in the "Query DSL":/guide/reference/query-dsl section), which _will_ reduce the documents they use for computing results. An example with a _term_ filter:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "facets" : {
        "<FACET NAME>" : {
            "<FACET TYPE>" : {
                ...
            },
            "facet_filter" : {
                "term" : { "user" : "kimchy"}
            }
        }
    }
}    
</pre>

Note that this is different from a facet of the "filter":/guide/reference/api/search/facets/filter-facet.html type.

h2. Facets with the _nested_ types

p. "Nested":/guide/reference/mapping/nested-type.html mapping allows for better support for "inner" documents faceting, especially when it comes to multi valued key and value facets (like histograms, or term stats).

p. Why is it good for? First of all, this is the only way to use facets on nested documents once they are used (possibly for other reasons). But, there is also facet specific reason why nested documents can be used, and that's the fact that facets working on different key and value field (like term_stats, or histogram) can now support cases where both are multi valued properly.

p. For example, lets use the following mapping:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "type1" : {
        "properties" : {
            "obj1" : {
                "type" : "nested"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. And, here is a sample data:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "obj1" : [
        {
            "name" : "blue",
            "count" : 4
        },
        {
            "name" : "green",
            "count" : 6
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

h3. Nested Query Facets

p. Any @nested@ query allows to specify a @_scope@ associated with it. Any @facet@ allows for a scope to be defined on it controlling the scope it will execute against. For example, the following @facet1@ terms stats facet will only run on documents matching the nested query associated with @my_scope@:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "query": {
        "nested": {
            "_scope": "my_scope",
            "path": "obj1",
            "score_mode": "avg",
            "query": {
                "bool": {
                    "must": [
                        {"text": {"obj1.name": "blue"}},
                        {"range": {"obj1.count": {"gt": 3}}}
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "facets": {
        "facet1": {
            "terms_stats": {
                "key_field": "obj1.name",
                "value_field": "obj1.count"
            },
            "scope": "my_scope"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h3. All Nested Matching Root Documents

p. Another option is to run the facet on all the nested documents matching the root objects that the main query will end up producing. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    },
    "facets": {
        "facet1": {
            "terms_stats": {
                "key_field" : "name",
                "value_field": "count"
            },
            "nested": "obj1"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @nested@ element provides the path to the nested document (can be a multi level nested docs) that will be used.
