p. A tokenizer of type @lowercase@ that performs the function of "Letter Tokenizer":letter-tokenizer.html and "Lower Case Token Filter":lowercase-tokenfilter.html together. It divides text at non-letters and converts them to lower case.  While it is functionally equivalent to the combination of "Letter Tokenizer":letter-tokenizer.html and "Lower Case Token Filter":lowercase-tokenizer.html, there is a performance advantage to doing the two tasks at once, hence this (redundant) implementation.
