p. This section describes the Java API that elasticsearch provides. All elasticsearch operations are executed using a "Client":client.html object. All operations are completely asynchronous in nature (either accepts a listener, or return a future).  

p. Additionally, operations on a client may be accumulated and executed in "Bulk":bulk.html.  

p. Note, all the "APIs":/guide/reference/api are exposed through the Java API (actually, the Java API is used internally to execute them).

h2. Maven Repository

p. elasticsearch is hosted on "Sonatype":http://www.sonatype.org/, with both a "releases repo":http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and a "snapshots repo":http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots.
