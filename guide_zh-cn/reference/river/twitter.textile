p. The twitter river indexes the public "twitter stream":http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api, aka the hose, and makes it searchable.

p. The twitter river is provided as a plugin and can be installed using @plugin -install river-twitter@.

p. Creating the twitter river can be done using:

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/my_twitter_river/_meta -d '
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "user" : "twitter_user",
        "password" : "twitter_passowrd"
    },
    "index" : {
        "index" : "my_twitter_river",
        "type" : "status",
        "bulk_size" : 100
    }
}
'
</pre>

p. The above lists all the options controlling the creation of a twitter river. The user and password are required in order to connect to the twitter stream.

p. Tweets will be indexed once a @bulk_size@ of them have been accumulated.

h1. Filtered Stream

p. Filtered stream can also be supported (as per the twitter stream API). Filter stream can be configured to support `tracks`, `follow`, and `locations`. The configuration is the same as the twitter API (a single comma separated string value, or using json arrays). Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "user" : "me",
        "passowrd" : "123456",
        "filter" : {
            "tracks" : "test,something,please",
            "follow" : "111,222,333",
            "locations" : "-122.75,36.8,-121.75,37.8,-74,40,-73,41"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. Here is an array based configuration example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "user" : "me",
        "passowrd" : "123456",
        "filter" : {
            "tracks" : ["test", "something"],
            "follow" : [111, 222, 333],
            "locations" : [ [-122.75,36.8], [-121.75,37.8], [-74,40], [-73,41]]
        }
    }
}
</pre>
