p. Matches spans which are near one another. One can specify _slop_, the maximum number of intervening unmatched positions, as well as whether matches are required to be in-order. The span near query maps to Lucene @SpanNearQuery@. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "span_near" : {
        "clauses" : [
            { "span_term" : { "field" : "value1" } },
            { "span_term" : { "field" : "value2" } },
            { "span_term" : { "field" : "value3" } }
        ],
        "slop" : 12,
        "in_order" : false,
        "collect_payloads" : false
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @clauses@ element is a list of one or more other span type queries and the @slop@ controls the maximum number of intervening unmatched positions permitted.
