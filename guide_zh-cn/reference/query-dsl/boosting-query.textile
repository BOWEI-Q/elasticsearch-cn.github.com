p. The @boosting@ query can be used to effectively demote results that match a given query. Unlike the "NOT" clause in bool query, this still selects documents that contain undesirable terms, but reduces their overall score.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "boosting" : {
        "positive" : {
            "term" : {
                "field1" : "value1"
            }
        },
        "negative" : {
            "term" : {
                "field2" : "value2"
            }
        },
        "negative_boost" : 0.2
    }
}
