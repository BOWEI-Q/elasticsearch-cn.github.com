p. Removes matches which overlap with another span query. The span not query maps to Lucene @SpanNotQuery@. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "span_not" : {
        Â©"include" : {
            "span_term" : { "field1" : "value1" }
        },
        "exclude" : {
            "span_term" : { "field2" : "value2" }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @include@ and @exclude@ clauses can be any span type query. The @include@ clause is the span query whose matches are filtered, and the @exclude@ clause is the span query whose matches must not overlap those returned.
