p. Filters documents that have fields that contain a term (*not analyzed*). Similar to term query, except that it acts as a filter. Can be placed within queries that accept a filter, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy"}
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h1. Caching

p. The result of the filter is automatically cached by default. The `_cache` can be set to `false` to turn it off. Here is an example:


<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { 
                "user" : "kimchy",
                "_cache" : false
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
