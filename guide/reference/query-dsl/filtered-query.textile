p. A query that applies a filter to the results of another query. This query maps to Lucene @FilteredQuery@.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : {
            "term" : { "tag" : "wow" }
        },
        "filter" : {
            "range" : {
                "age" : { "from" : 10, "to" : 20 }
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The filter object can hold only filter elements, not queries. Filters can be much faster compared to queries since they don't perform any scoring, especially when they are cached.
