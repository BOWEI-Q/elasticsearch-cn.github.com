p. Matches documents that have fields matching a wildcard expression (*not analyzed*). Supported wildcards are @*@, which matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and @?@, which matches any single character. Note this query can be slow, as it needs to iterate over many terms. In order to prevent extremely slow wildcard queries, a wildcard term should not start with one of the wildcards @*@ or @?@. The wildcard query maps to Lucene @WildcardQuery@.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "wildcard" : { "user" : "ki*y" }
}
</pre>

p. A boost can also be associated with the query:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "wildcard" : { "user" : { "value" : "ki*y", "boost" : 2.0 } }
}    
</pre>

p. Or :

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "wildcard" : { "user" : { "wildcard" : "ki*y", "boost" : 2.0 } }
}    
</pre>

p. This multi term query allows to control how it gets rewritten using the "rewrite":multi-term-rewrite.html parameter.
