p. The delete by query API allows to delete documents from one or more indices and one or more types based on a query. The query can either be provided the "Query DSL":../query_dsl. Here is an example:


<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
import static org.elasticsearch.index.query.xcontent.FilterBuilders.*;
import static org.elasticsearch.index.query.xcontent.QueryBuilders.*;

DeleteByQueryResponse response = client.prepareDeleteByQuery("test")
        .setQuery(termQuery("_type", "type1"))
        .execute()
        .actionGet();
</pre>

p. For more information on the delete by query operation, check out the "delete_by_query API":/guide/reference/api/delete-by-query.html docs.
