p. The hadoop (HDFS) based gateway stores the cluster meta and indices data in hadoop. Hadoop support is provided as a plugin and installing is as simply as executing @plugin -install hadoop@ or downloading the hadoop plugin and placing it under the @plugins@ directory. Here is an example config to enable it:

<pre class="prettyprint">
gateway:
    type: hdfs
    hdfs:
        uri: hdfs://myhost:8022
</pre>

h1. Settings

p. The hadoop gateway requires two simple settings. The @gateway.hdfs.uri@ controls the URI to connect to the hadoop cluster, for example: @hdfs://myhost:8022@. The @gateway.hdfs.path@ controls the path under which the gateway will store the data.

h1. concurrent_streams

p. The @gateway.hdfs.concurrent_streams@ allow to throttle the number of streams (per node) opened against the shared gateway performing the snapshot operation. It defaults to @5@.
